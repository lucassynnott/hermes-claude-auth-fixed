# hermes-claude-auth
Claude Code OAuth bypass for hermes-agent, use your Claude Code subscription (Max/Pro) with Hermes.

## What this does
Patches hermes-agent at runtime to pass Anthropic's server-side OAuth content validation. It does not modify hermes-agent source files. Installation happens through a Python import hook that monkey-patches `build_anthropic_kwargs` on startup.

## Why this exists
On 2026-04-04, Anthropic added server-side validation that rejects OAuth requests from third-party tools. This patch adds the billing header signature and system prompt structure the API expects.

## Prerequisites
- hermes-agent installed (`~/.hermes/hermes-agent/`)
- Claude Code CLI authenticated (valid credentials at `~/.claude/.credentials.json`)
- hermes-agent configured for OAuth (`credential_pool` has a `claude_code` entry in `~/.hermes/auth.json`)
- Python 3.11+

## Install
```bash
# Remote install (one-liner)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Meapri/hermes-claude-auth/main/install-remote.sh | bash

# Or clone manually
git clone https://github.com/Meapri/hermes-claude-auth.git
cd hermes-claude-auth
./install.sh
```

What `install.sh` does:
- Copies `anthropic_billing_bypass.py` to `~/.hermes/patches/`
- Installs the import hook as `sitecustomize.py` in the hermes venv's site-packages
- Restarts `hermes-gateway.service` if running

## Uninstall
```bash
./uninstall.sh          # remove hook only
./uninstall.sh --purge  # remove hook + patch file
```

## How it works
1. **Billing header**: SHA-256 signed `x-anthropic-billing-header` injected as `system[0]`
2. **System prompt relocation**: Non-identity system entries moved to the first user message as `<system-reminder>` blocks
3. **Beta flags**: Adds `prompt-caching-scope-2026-01-05` and `advisor-tool-2026-03-01`
4. **Stainless SDK spoof**: Lowercase `x-stainless-*` headers + `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` + `?beta=true` query param matching real Claude Code 2.1.112
5. **Tool name namespacing**: Hermes's `mcp_bash` is rewritten to `mcp__hermes__Bash` outbound; the response normalizer unwraps it back to `bash` so hermes's tool dispatcher resolves the registered name without auto-repair noise
6. **Tool pair repair**: Orphaned `tool_use` / `tool_result` blocks (left by long conversations or partial summaries) are stripped before signing — prevents HTTP 400 (upstream PR #136)
7. **Haiku effort stripping**: `effort` parameter is removed for haiku models that reject it with HTTP 400 (upstream PR #126)
8. **Temperature fix**: Strips non-default `temperature` on Opus 4.6 adaptive thinking, which otherwise rejects with HTTP 400
9. **Account metadata**: Maps `~/.claude.json::oauthAccount.accountUuid` to `metadata.user_id` (Anthropic rejected the older `account_uuid` key with HTTP 400 on 2026-04-29)

Installed through a `sitecustomize.py` MetaPathFinder hook, so it runs at interpreter startup with no source modifications.

## What gets modified
| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `~/.hermes/patches/anthropic_billing_bypass.py` | Created |
| `<venv>/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/sitecustomize.py` | Created or replaced |
| `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/.git/hooks/post-merge` | Created (auto-recovery after `hermes update`) |
| hermes-agent source files | NOT modified |

## After Hermes Update

When you run `hermes update` (which does `git pull` + `pip install`), the
`sitecustomize.py` inside the venv may be overwritten. The patch file survives.

**Automatic recovery (default).** `install.sh` installs a git `post-merge` hook
into `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/.git/hooks/`, so the moment `hermes update` runs its
`git pull`, the hook detects the missing hook and re-runs recovery automatically.
If the Google Antigravity plugin is also installed, its coexistence
`sitecustomize.py` (which already contains the Claude hook) is restored first and
this installer leaves it untouched — the two patches never clobber each other.

> **Keep the clone in a persistent path** (e.g. `~/hermes-claude-auth`), **not
> `/tmp`**. The post-merge hook looks for the installer at
> `$HOME/hermes-claude-auth/install.sh` first; a `/tmp` clone is wiped on reboot
> and auto-recovery silently can't run.

**Check what's broken** (verifies files exist AND match the repo byte-for-byte):
```bash
cd ~/hermes-claude-auth
./install.sh --check
```
`--check` flags **content drift** too — if the installed
`anthropic_billing_bypass.py` differs from the repo (e.g. a hot-fix was applied
to one but not synced to the other), it reports `[!] DRIFT` so you can sync the
newer copy back before a clean install silently reverts it. The shared
`sitecustomize.py` is intentionally not compared (it legitimately differs when
the Antigravity plugin's multi-hook version is installed).

**Recover (only restores sitecustomize.py + patch):**
```bash
cd ~/hermes-claude-auth
git pull && ./install.sh --post-update
```

**Full recovery:**
```bash
cd ~/hermes-claude-auth
git pull && ./install.sh
```

### What survives `hermes update`

| File | Location | Survives? |
|------|----------|:---:|
| `anthropic_billing_bypass.py` | `~/.hermes/patches/` | ✅ Outside repo |
| **`sitecustomize.py`** | venv `site-packages/` | ❌ Overwritten |
| Claude credentials | `~/.claude/` | ✅ Managed by Claude CLI |
| Auth token | `~/.hermes/auth.json` | ✅ Outside repo |

Only `sitecustomize.py` needs recovery. `--post-update` does exactly that.

## Compatibility
- Tested with hermes-agent on Python 3.11+
- Linux and macOS
- Depends on `build_anthropic_kwargs(is_oauth=...)` in `agent.anthropic_adapter`, so it may need updating if hermes-agent changes that interface

## Troubleshooting

### Install issues
- **"hermes-agent not found"**: Make sure Hermes is installed at `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/`
- **"No virtualenv found"**: Set `HERMES_VENV` to point to your venv
- **Patch not loading**: Check `journalctl --user -u hermes-gateway -n 50` for `[anthropic_billing_bypass]` or `[hermes-claude-auth]` messages

### Auth issues

- **`Anthropic 401 authentication failed`** or **`No Anthropic credentials found`**: Hermes reads Claude subscription credentials from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. If Claude Code is authenticated (e.g. in macOS Keychain) but that file is missing or stale, Hermes fails even when Claude Code itself works.

  On macOS, `install.sh` v1.1.1+ auto-mirrors the `Claude Code-credentials` Keychain entry into `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on every run, so re-running the installer is usually enough. Full fix:

  1. Refresh Claude subscription login:
     ```bash
     claude auth login --claudeai
     ```
  2. Re-run the installer to re-mirror credentials (macOS) and reload the patch:
     ```bash
     ./install.sh
     ```
  3. Remove stale `ANTHROPIC_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` values from `~/.hermes/.env` — they can override subscription auth.
  4. Reset cached credentials:
     ```bash
     hermes auth reset anthropic
     ```
  5. Retry with a smoke test:
     ```bash
     hermes chat -q 'Reply with exactly: AUTH TEST OK' --provider anthropic -m claude-sonnet-4-6 -Q
     ```

  If the auto-mirror doesn't work (e.g. your Keychain entry is under a different service name), mirror it manually:
  ```bash
  python3 - <<'PY'
  import subprocess
  from pathlib import Path

  secret = subprocess.check_output(
      ['security', 'find-generic-password', '-s', 'Claude Code-credentials', '-w'],
      text=True,
  ).strip()

  cred_path = Path.home() / '.claude' / '.credentials.json'
  cred_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
  cred_path.write_text(secret)
  cred_path.chmod(0o600)
  print(f'wrote {cred_path}')
  PY
  ```

  Credit: the macOS Keychain mirror approach was written up by [@DrQbz](https://github.com/DrQbz) in [issue #5](https://github.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth/issues/5) and is now automated in `install.sh`.

### Billing / routing issues

- **HTTP 400: "Third-party apps now draw from your extra usage, not your plan limits"**: Anthropic's server-side validation has classified your requests as third-party and routed them to pay-per-token credits instead of your Max/Pro plan. Make sure you're on the latest version of this patch (it tracks the upstream [opencode-claude-auth](https://github.com/griffinmartin/opencode-claude-auth) fingerprint changes). Reinstall with `./install.sh` and restart `hermes-gateway`. If the error persists after update, the bypass is currently broken upstream too — track [issue #6](https://github.com/kristianvast/hermes-claude-auth/issues/6) for status.
- **HTTP 400 persists after update**: The billing salt or signature format may have been rotated by Anthropic again. Check for newer commits to this repo.
